# internshipDatabase

An exploration of persistent storage in R Shiny via a SQLite database. 

### Inspiration: 

Last semester I had a hard time managing my internship applications, and these troubles discouraged me from applying to internships at all (not good). I realised that maybe if I created my own mini application to address this, I would actually apply to internships (as I should be doing) and stay on top of the status of each. 

### The app: 

There are four tabs: 

- **Create entries**: enter information about each internship you apply for

- **Track Offers/Rejections**: track the internships you've heard back from

- **Filter Entries**: use SQL commands to filter or alter tables

- **To Check Out**: record and track internships that you plan to apply to

- **Resources**: statistics and resources to guide you during the application cycle
