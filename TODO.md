## TODO

Transferring the app from R to Python - R Shiny is great but is not as well developed as Streamlit. Aim is to address items in README.md TODO before summer 2025 internship application season.

Specific TODO items: 

* Look into user authentication in Streamlit. I would think that there are example apps. Keep this in mind as you transfer the app, even if it is a later step (https://blog.streamlit.io/streamlit-authenticator-part-1-adding-an-authentication-component-to-your-app/)
* Maintaining and using databases in Streamlit. Again there are probably example apps
	* This will allow me to combine the Create Entries and Update Statuses tabs - this would be very beneficial for user experience.
* Caching is something I could not do before. This will go along w user authentication
* Editable dataframes/tables, and making sure changes are written to the actual database
